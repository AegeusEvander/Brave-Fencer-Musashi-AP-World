### Configuring BizHawk

Once you have installed BizHawk, open `EmuHawk.exe` and change the following settings:

- If you're using BizHawk 2.7 or 2.8, go to `Config > Customize`. On the Advanced tab, switch the Lua Core from
`NLua+KopiLua` to `Lua+LuaInterface`, then restart EmuHawk. (If you're using BizHawk 2.9, you can skip this step.)
- Under `Config > Customize`, check the "Run in background" option to prevent disconnecting from the client while you're tabbed out of EmuHawk.
- Open any PlayStation game in EmuHawk and go to `Config > Controllers…` to configure your inputs. If you can't click `Controllers…`, it's because you need to load a game first (depending on version may not be needed).
- Consider clearing keybinds in `Config > Hotkeys…` if you don't intend to use them. Select the keybind and press Esc to clear it.
- Under `Tools > Lua Console` and on the new Lua Console window `Settings > check Autoload with EmuHawk`

## Patching the BIN file

1. launch `Delta Patcher`
2. For original file select an unmodified `Brave Fencer Musashi (USA) (Track 1).bin`
3. For xDelta patch select the downloaded xdelta patch linked above.
4. `Apply patch`
5. A patched bin can be used for multiple games just keep careful track of save files and memory cards. It is also suggested to update the folder name to denote a patched file

## Generating a Game

1. Open `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`
2. Create your options file (YAML). After placing the `bfm.apworld` file into the custom_worlds folder, you can generate a template within the Archipelago Launcher by clicking `Generate Template Settings`.
3. Follow the general Archipelago instructions for [generating a game](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game).

## Connecting to a Server

1. Open your `Brave Fencer Musashi (USA).cue` file in EmuHawk.
2. In EmuHawk, go to `Tools > Lua Console`. This window must stay open in order to send or recieve items.
3. In the Lua Console window, go to `Script > Open Script…`.
4. Navigate to your Archipelago install folder and open `data/lua/connector_bizhawk_generic.lua`.
5. Select "BizHawk Client" in the right-side column. On your first time opening BizHawk Client, you may also be asked to locate `EmuHawk.exe` in your BizHawk install.
6. The emulator and client will eventually connect to each other. The BizHawk Client window should indicate that it connected and recognized Brave Fencer Musashi.
7. To connect the client to the server, enter your room's address and port (e.g. `archipelago.gg:38281`) into the top text field of the client and click Connect.

You should now be able to receive and send items. You'll need to do these steps every time you want to reconnect. After selecting the script once you can instead use `File > Recent Scripts`. It is safe to make progress offline though it will be needed to be connected to receive items and for shop randomization; everything will re-sync when you reconnect.
